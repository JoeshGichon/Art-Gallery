      <h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
      <p> This is a platform where artist can provide their work and display it for all to see.</p>
      <p>In the process we aim to allow artists to reach their audience without much difficulty and also aim to prevent swindlers from stealing art and presenting it as their own.</p>
